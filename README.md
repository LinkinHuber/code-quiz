# code-quiz

## what was the goal of this project?

 - The goal of this project was to create a code quiz that asks you a series of questions and saves your final score/initials. I achived this by starting with an initial loading page that contains a timer at the top and a short paragraph about the quiz with a start button. You then press the start button, it starts the timer, the intro page disappears, and a question appears. Once you click on an answer another question appears and so on... After you answer all of the questions a prompt will appear asking for your initials. After you enter your initials the question page will disappear and the scoreboard will appear. Your initials will then appear on the scoreboard along with your score. Your score is determined by how many seconds are remaining so complete the quiz quick for a good score, go slow for a bad score, or risk having the time run out... If the time runs out, the quiz ends and you lose! Refresh the page to play again, have fun!
